# TNTRun_reloaded

This is forked from the original (now unsupported) TNTRun by Shevchik (for Minecraft 1.9) and has been updated to work on Minecraft versions 1.10.2 through to 1.13.1.

The release of version 6.8 of TNTRun\_reloaded is the final release to support all Minecraft versions from 1.8 through to 1.12.2.<br>
Starting with version 7.0 of TNTRun\_reloaded, the plugin will only run on Minecraft versions 1.13 and later.

## Description

TNTRun is a fully automated minigame plugin that is based on the popular map TNTRUN. For those who don't know what it is, here is an explanation.
Players start on a layer of sand and every block that they step on disappears. If they fall through a hole, they continue on the layer of sand below. 
When  a player falls through the final layer he loses the game. The last player wins the game.
