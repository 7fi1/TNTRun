# TNTRun_reloaded

This is forked from the original (now unsupported) TNTRun by Shevchik (v6.3.2) and includes commits by SimSonic to enable it to work on MC version 1.10.2 and by steve4744 to enable it run on MC versions and 1.11 and 1.12.

TNTRun is a fully automated minigame plugin that is based on the popular map TNTRUN. For those who don't know what is it, here is an explanation.
Players start on layer of sand and every block that they step on disappears. If  a player falls through the final layer he loses the game. The last player wins the game.

Features:

Multiple arenas <br />
Block destroy delay <br />
Custom gamelevel <br />
AntiCamping system <br />
Custom messages <br />
Formatting codes support <br />
Signs <br />
Time limit <br />
