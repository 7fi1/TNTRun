# TNTRun_reloaded

This was originally forked from the (now unsupported) TNTRun by Shevchik for Minecraft v1.9 and has been improved and updated as new versions of Minecraft have been released, so that it supports all Minecraft versions from 1.8 through to 1.13.2.

However, as a result of the huge number of changes brought in by Mojang in Minecraft v1.13, begining with version 7.0 of TNTRun\_reloaded, the plugin will only run on Minecraft versions 1.13 and later. All future development work will be done on this version and not back-ported to the legacy version.

The legacy version of TNTRun\_reloaded is the final release to support all Minecraft versions from 1.8 through to 1.12.2. This version is still available for download and will still be supported where possible.

## Description

TNTRun is a fully automated minigame plugin that is based on the popular map TNTRUN. For those who don't know what it is, here is an explanation.
Players start on a layer of sand and every block that they step on disappears. If they fall through a hole, they continue on the layer of sand below. 
When  a player falls through the final layer he loses the game. The last player wins the game.

## Download

If your server is running Minecraft 1.13 or later, then the latest version of TNTRun\_reloaded can be [downloaded from Spigot.](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/tntrun_reloaded.53359/ "TNTRun_reloaded")
