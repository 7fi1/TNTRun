# TNTRun_reloaded

This is forked from the original (now unsupported) TNTRun by Shevchik (v6.3.2) and has been updated to work on MC versions 1.10.2, 1.11 and 1.12.2.

TNTRun is a fully automated minigame plugin that is based on the popular map TNTRUN. For those who don't know what is it, here is an explanation.
Players start on a layer of sand and every block that they step on disappears. If  a player falls through the final layer he loses the game. The last player wins the game.
